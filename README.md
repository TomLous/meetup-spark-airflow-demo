# Spark & Airflow demo for Data Driven Rijnmond meetup

Contains simple example using small Spark Jobs and Airflow pipeline on Google Cloud

The pipeline consists of ETL 2 json files, matching them in 2 different ways, merging them and storing the result in Elastic Search

Try to change & run the scripts/xx-xxx.sh files in order to create yourown setup  
Your experience may differ from mine. :-)
